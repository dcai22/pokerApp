Since we are working with react-router v7, root.tsx should export the component App which contains <Outlet />
This uses the RouteConfig defined in routes.ts
The index route is the route corresponding to "/"

Routes depending on an id must export loader and action functions



02/04/2025
There was a problem in register.tsx where calling axios.put(...) with a duplicate username would cause an uncaught 400 error
I thought this was a problem with my backend route, but the solution was to wrap the axios.put(...) call with a try-catch block
For the backend, pool.query(...) can throw an error that needs to be caught in a try-catch block
However you cannot simply perform res.status(400), you need to do res.status(400).json(), i.e., there must be a `.json()`

TODO: add parameter checks to loaders (DONE)
NOTE: parameter checks will be done with tokens stored in localStorage
      Token is purged upon loading the register and login routes (DONE)
      Token is created after successful register/login (DONE)
      all other routes will verify the token in their loader
TODO: change all names `hash` to either `hashedPassword` or `hashedToken`   (DONE)



04/04/2025
Many methods of dealing with tokens don't work due to this app using Server Side Rendering (SSR)
This is why I can't use localStorage or sessionStorage
Instead, I will store tokens in the url when redirecting
This new strategy will limit the user to a single session at a time
Revised plan for tokens:
 - Tokens will be added to the url for protected sites
    - Loader function for these sites will check the url
 - Register and login will create a new token upon success
 - Login will remove all other tokens from the database

I notice storing tokens in the URL is a security risk, so I will try using cookies:
https://reactrouter.com/explanation/sessions-and-cookies
TODO:
 - URLs should no longer have the player_id param for security purposes     (DONE)
    - The loader can process the token and return user details              (DONE)
 - Cookie is checked in loader of register/login                            (DONE)
    - A redirect is performed if a token is found                           (DONE)
 - Cookie is stored upon successful login/register                          (DONE)
 - All redirects should use commitSession() or similar                      (DONE)
 - Some way to automatically clear tokens from db                           **TODO**
NOTES:
 - session.flash(...) can be used to set a value temporarily, useful for errors

Those are linked to the server, while Logout is linked to the client.

Using shadcn for frontend

Using socket.io for live updates
https://dev.to/novu/building-a-chat-app-with-socketio-and-react-2edj?comments_sort=top
```
const io = new Server(server, {
    cors: {
        origin: "http://localhost:5173",
        methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    }
});
```
```
app.use(cors({
    origin: "http://localhost:5173",
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type"],
}));
```
Note the origins use `localhost` rather than `127.0.0.1`
This is actually important for what URL to open in a browser



08/04/2025
After successfully using sockets yesterday, today's goal is to work on the actual table.
Here is the general plan for the app functionality:

Players can join the room, and the room lobby should show a list of all players.
Before the game starts, there should be a button to randomise the positions of all players.
 - Roll positions button
 - Reroll and confirm buttons
A player should be able to join the game mid-session.
Their position should be randomised upon joining.

Each player's current buyin should be displayed.
A 'buyin' button should be present.
Buyin history can be showed with a button.

Each table plays multiple rounds of poker, each of which is called a 'hand'.
In each hand:
 - Each player inputs their hand which then gets hidden
 - Each player then gets an option to VPIP
After everyone has input their hand and VPIP, the owner can press a 'next hand' button.

There should be a button to display hand stats -- vpip, hand history, etc.

Limitations:
My implementation will only work with one active table.

ERRORS:
For some reason, sockets open multiple times, so the socket `addPlayer` is reached twice.
There is an issue with my sessions where different tabs will be logged into the same user,
even on incognito mode.

It turns out I can use sessionStorage etc. as long as I do not have loader/action functions.
Those functions are useful for Server Side Rendering (SSR) but are problematic for Client
Side Rendering (CSR). If necessary, the alternative functions `clientLoader` etc. can be used.
This will allow me to store cookies properly, and resolve the issue of session cookies being
the same throughout multiple tabs, which made testing very difficult / impossible.
SSR can be turned on/off via react-router.config.ts



09/04/2025
The goal for today is to use session storage for cookies.
All loader and action functions will be moved to the Component.
This way, sessionStorage and window can be used without any issues.

For get requests:
In Component.tsx:   axios.get(`URL?param1=${val1}&param2=${val2}`);
In app.ts:          const param1 = req.query.param1; const param2 = req.query.param2;



10/04/2025
io.emit replies to all sockets
socket.emit replies to the single socket

To prevent automatically connecting:
socket = io.connect("URL", { autoConnect: false });
And in the component, run `socket.connect()` inside useEffect.
If you run it in the component instead of in useEffect, it may duplicate.

array.splice(...) changes array itself. It does not return the new array.



12/04/2025
I will talk about my plan to achieve each of the goals laid out on 08/04/2025:

```
Players can join the room, and the room lobby should show a list of all players.
Before the game starts, there should be a button to randomise the positions of all players.
 - Roll positions button
 - Reroll and confirm buttons
```
This has been reworked into a room that has positions automatically randomised.
There is no rerolling to prevent abuse of the system.
DONE.

```
A player should be able to join the game mid-session.
Their position should be randomised upon joining.
```
EDIT: a player should NOT be able to join a table once it has started.
Will have to think about how the `Leave Table` button will interact with table_players;

```
Each player's current buyin should be displayed.
A 'buyin' button should be present.
Buyin history can be showed with a button.
```
Buyin is stored in table_player.
There is a list of names at the top of the screen with their total buyins listed below.
The player's name in the list is annotated with '(You)'.
A buyin button will give a pop-up where you can enter a buyin amount.
This buyin will be added to the database with a timestamp, and sockets will be used to
update the total buyin of this player on all screens.
DONE.

```
Each table plays multiple rounds of poker, each of which is called a 'hand'.
In each hand:
 - Each player inputs their hand which then gets hidden
 - Each player then gets an option to VPIP
After everyone has input their hand and VPIP, the owner can press a 'next hand' button.
```
There is an 'enter hand' button which gives a pop-up where you can select your hand,
probably through selecting rank and suit of the cards given in a table.
The player then 'confirm's their hand, exiting the pop-up and disabling the 'enter hand'
button until the next hand starts.
.
There is a 'VPIP' button which gives a pop-up for 'yes' or 'no'.
The player then 'confirm's their choice, exiting the pop-up and disabling the 'VPIP'
button until the next hand starts.
.
The owner has access to a 'next hand' button.
This button is disabled by default, but is enabled when every player has VPIP'd.
This button resets the hands and VPIPs, and moves the positions.
The hand no. should be displayed somewhere on screen e.g. `Hand no. 12`.
DONE.

```
There should be a button to display hand stats -- vpip, hand history, etc.
```
I will aim to have an export option for this info somehow.


HTML input components return strings by default, even if type="number".
To fix this, set onChange={(e) => field.onChange(Number(e.target.value))}.
Alternatively, you can use z.coerce.number() as the type, rathern than z.number().

To have a Form inside a Dialog:
```
<Dialog>
    <Form>
        <DialogContent>
            <form>
                ...
            </form>
        </DialogContent>
    </Form>
</Dialog>
```



13/04/2025
To fix up later:
 - Security in tables
    - Figure out when tables should let someone join, either through
      joinTable or directly through URL (e.g. on refresh)




14/04/2025
I finished making the table fully functional.
Now I just need to implement more security features (as mentioned yesterday), and
improve the aesthetic of the app.

On top of the security concern mentioned yesterday, I need sockets to communicate
to other sockets within the same table.
Also, the rank and suit selections should be randomised to prevent cheating.



15/04/2025
More detail about security
 - Players in the table lobby can be active or inactive (DONE)
    - In a hand, there will be a 'Sit Out' or 'Deal Me In' button to change status (DONE)
 - Players join active tables with inactive status by default (sockets should take care of this) (DONE)
    - Their status can be stored in table_players to fetch (DONE)
    - It can also be stored in the `players` variable (DONE)
 - Players can change between active and inactive status when in the table lobby (DONE)
 - This status takes effect immediately (DONE)
    - Except if they have already VPIP'd, and then become inactive; this takes effect next hand (DONE)
    - hasEnteredHand and hasVpip must be set on pageload in case they have already submitted their hand,
      then leave the table, rejoin, and set their status to active again (DONE)
 - Upon socket disconnect, the player's status becomes inactive (DONE)
 - A hand cannot be played with < 2 active players; a 'Waiting...' screen will be shown (DONE)

 - A new user can join an inactive table (until it's full) with default active status (DONE)
 - A user can join an active table if they are already in it (DONE)
 - A user on the '/tables' page will be kicked out if they are not on the table (DONE)
 - If a user enters the '/tables' page and they are on the table, fetch their status from db (DONE)

 - 'Next Hand' button will only require all ACTIVE players to have VPIP'd (DONE)

NOTES: there was a lot of socket duplication due to socket.on() being placed outside of useEffect.
Since the component unmounts/remounts frequently, this results in exponentially duplicating sockets.
FIX: Place socket.on() inside useEffect, and return () => { socket.off() } in useEffect.



16/04/2025
Completed all security features discussed yesterday



17/04/2025
The difficult part of the app has been done -- the table functionality, entering hands and vpips, etc.
Now I will just be adding quality of life features. For example:
 - Adding a 'filter by player' feature for buyins (including 'show all buyins') (DONE)
 - A hand history button to show a player's own hands (DONE)
    - A separate tab for showing hand statistics (e.g. suited, connected, pairs) (DONE)
 - Owner can press an 'end game' button, and players can all agree to end the game (DONE)
    - Once the game officially ends, all hand details are shown (DONE)
    - These hand details can be exported
 - Option to edit hand after entering it (might be abused by players)
 - A solo, offline mode without the table features

I will also refactor table.tsx into its Components so that adding/editing Components is easier. (DONE)

Since socket.on() is called within useEffect(), which interacts strangely with useState(), variables
initialised with useState() should not be used in any socketHandle...() function.

The SQL 'IN' operator requires parentheses, and does not work with an empty array.
This is difficult to achieve with parametrisation.



18/04/2025
Successfully deployed app.
 - Database: Neon
 - Backend: Render (branch: 'deployment')
 - Frontend: Vercel

.env variables are hidden from the deployed frontend/backend. They can be set on Vercel and Render after.



19/04/2025
It seems running bcrypt.compare() on so many tokens is very expensive.
This gives me incentive to have tokens expire in the database so that fewer hashes need to be checked.

Tailwind fails to properly render dynamic class names involving `hover:`.
For example, `hover:{getTextColour()}` doesn't work, since getTextColour() is generated dynamically.
Instead, consider hardcoding all cases with the full name, e.g. `isRed() ? "hover:text-red-500" : "hover:text-black"`.

13/05/2025
Sensitive storage stored in .env and server/db.ts was removed with the help of GitHub Support.

14/05/2025
Today's goal is to improve the user experience.
Data stored in session storage will be moved to local storage. This should prevent a bug where users are redirected
to the home screen if they have been inactive for too long.
Other tokens for a player will be purged upon login. This means a player can only be logged in on one device at a time.
Loading spinners will be added where required to reduce loading time frustration.
https://shadcnui-expansions.typeart.cc/docs/spinner

Fixed bug in backend where the local storage token wasn't actually checked because I was using array find() with an
async function.

28/05/2025
Made the table ID a unique 4-digit number.
Currently, only 9000 unique table IDs are possible.
This is not an issue at the current scale, but I may implement a way to automatically remove inactive tables from the database.

Also fixed an issue with Dialog boxes not resetting the radio value on re-open.
This was fixed by using `<Dialog onOpenChange={handleOpenChange}>`, with handleOpenChange resetting the form through `form.reset(...);`.

13/06/2025
Looking into concurrency now. Code snippet from server.ts:
```
const tableLocks = new Map<string, Promise<void>>();

function withTableLocks<T>(tableId: string, fn: () => Promise<T>) {
    const prev = tableLocks.get(tableId) || Promise.resolve();

    let release: () => void;
    const next = new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
        release = resolve
    });

    const run = prev.then(async () => {
        try {
            return await fn();
        } finally {
            release();
        }
    });

    tableLocks.set(tableId, next);
    return run;
}
```

This took me a while to understand, but to summarise:
 - `tableLocks` maps each table to a "queue of functions" (not an actual queue data structure)
 - in `withTableLocks`, `prev` is a queue of previous functions (or empty if there are none)
 - I initially thought `resolve` was the function that runs after the Promise resolves. I believe I was wrong, and that it
   is actually the function that **marks** the Promise as resolved
    - This means `release = resolve` stores the resolver of the Promise as a function that can be called later, allowing
      .then(...) handlers to run
 - The actual function we want to run is `run`. It waits for previous functions in the queue to finish, runs `fn`, then
   releases, allowing for future functions to start running
 - tableLocks.set(...) is necessary so that future calls to withTableLocks queue properly
 - `run` is finally called, signalling that it will run as soon as it reaches its turn in the queue

This concurrency handling is necessary due to some socket updates, such as "changeStatus", updating the database and then returning
the new state. This can be problematic if multiple sockets are running this simultaneously, e.g.,
```
socket A updates the database
socket A reads from the updated database
socket B updates the database
socket B reads from the updated database
socket B returns data from the most recent database change
socket A returns data from a previous database change
```

Furthermore, JS is a single-threaded language, and 'context switches' (or the JS equivalent) don't occur unless .then(...) or await
are used. This is what allowed for me to update the `tableLocks` map without concurrency issues.
