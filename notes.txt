Since we are working with react-router v7, root.tsx should export the component App which contains <Outlet />
This uses the RouteConfig defined in routes.ts
The index route is the route corresponding to "/"

Routes depending on an id must export loader and action functions

There was a problem in register.tsx where calling axios.put(...) with a duplicate username would cause an uncaught 400 error
I thought this was a problem with my backend route, but the solution was to wrap the axios.put(...) call with a try-catch block
For the backend, pool.query(...) can throw an error that needs to be caught in a try-catch block
However you cannot simply perform res.status(400), you need to do res.status(400).json(), i.e., there must be a `.json()`

Request body can be sent in axios.get(...) and axios.delete(...) as follows:
```
await axios.get(
    URL,
    {
        data: {
            var1: val1,
            var2: val2,
        },
    }
);
```
